st.write('''PEM electrolyser systems were developed to overcome some of the operational drawbacks 
of alkaline electrolysers. They use pure water as an
electrolyte solution, and so avoid the recovery and recycling of the potassium hydroxide
electrolyte solution that is necessary with alkaline electrolysers. They are smaller than 
alkaline electrolysers and produce highly compressed hydrogen for decentralised production and storage at
refuelling stations (30â€“60 bar without an additional compressor and up to 100â€“200 bar in some
systems, compared to 1â€“30 bar for alkaline electrolysers). Their operating range can
go from zero load to 160% of design capacity (so it is possible to overload the electrolyser for
some time, if the plant and power electronics have been designed accordingly). Against this,
however, they need expensive electrode catalysts (platinum, iridium) and membrane materials,
and their lifetime is currently shorter than that of alkaline electrolysers. Their overall costs are
currently higher than those of alkaline electrolysers, and currently they are less widely deployed.''')
